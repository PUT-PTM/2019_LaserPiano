# LaserPiano

## Overview
  The goal of the project is to build an one octave piano. Instead pressing the keys, sound plays when pianist breaks the laser beam.

Project contains interruption service on pins PE0-PE7. Sound is generated using CS43L22 module. Every note is a composition of three sine waves. Their frequencies referens to their first harmonics.
## Tools
STM32F4407VG Discovery Microcontroller
8 Laser diodes
8 Fototransistors
Cables
Wires

## How to run
Connect all required tools as table below says:

| PIN  | TOOL |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| PE3 | Fototransistor GND |
| PE4 | Fototransistor GND |
| PE5 | Fototransistor GND |
| PE6 | Fototransistor GND |
| PD8 | Fototransistor GND |
| PD9 | Fototransistor GND |
| PD10 | Fototransistor GND |
| PD11 | Fototransistor GND |
| VCC 3V | Fototransistors VCC |

It is also needed to power up the laser diodes with an external power supply.

## How to Compile
Run program in System Workbench Developers C/C++ for STM32.
## Future improvements
Making more compact box.
Adding complex sounds.
Developing the number of notes.
